## Hi, I'm Mason!

I graduated in May 2020 from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Studies, and I am now pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://tse-fr.eu/). 

My primary research interests include industrial organization, game theory, and political economy, and my recent university projects include [capital concentration in Argentina](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/radical-party/) at the beginning of the 20th century, [populism and economic inequality in Turkey](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/populism-and-inequality-in-turkey/), the optimization of pay-what-you-want pricing models, and the relationship between increasing [industrial concentration and inequality in the United States](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/the-inegalitarian-spiral/). 

For my personal projects, I have created an R package, [`sciteR`](https://github.com/masonrhayes/sciteR), to gather journal-level citation data from [scite](https://scite.ai), a [Shiny web app](https://masonrhayes.shinyapps.io/coronavirus_app/) to track the spread of COVID-19, and a [simple R script](https://github.com/masonrhayes/cryptocurrency_analysis) to quickly visualize cryptocurrency price trends.

## Open to work
My experience is primarily in economics, and I am looking for an internship where I can apply economic understanding alongside data science tools. For example, an internship in financial forecasting, market regulation, competition policy, or another field related to economics / data science! Preferably in France or remotely.
