## Hi, I'm Mason!

I graduated from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Studies, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://tse-fr.eu/). 

My primary research interests include industrial organization, game theory, and political economy, and my recent university projects include capital concentration in Argentina at the beginning of the 20th century, populism and economic inequality in Turkey, the optimization of pay-what-you-want pricing models, and the relationship between increasing industrial concentration and inequality in the United States. 

Outside of university-related projects, I have created an R package, [`sciteR`](https://github.com/masonrhayes/sciteR), to gather journal-level citation data from [scite](https://scite.ai), a [Shiny web app](https://masonrhayes.shinyapps.io/coronavirus_app/) to track the spread of COVID-19, and a [simple R script](https://github.com/masonrhayes/cryptocurrency_analysis) to quickly visualize cryptocurrency price trends.
