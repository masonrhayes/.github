## Hi, I'm Mason!

I recently graduated from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Studies, and I will start my Master’s degree in Economics this fall at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://tse-fr.eu/). 

My primary research interests include economic inequality, game theory and behavior, and industrial organization. My recent projects include capital concentration in Argentina at the beginning of the 20th century, the optimization of pay-what-you-want pricing models, and the relationship between increasing industrial concentration and inequality in the United States.
